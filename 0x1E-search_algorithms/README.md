# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
### Description
This project is about search algorithms like linear and binary search, also the time of complexity of some algorithms.

#### Mandatory Tasks

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [0-linear.c](0-linear.c) | Function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm |
